* Foreword

The present study is the result of many years of research surrounding the
concept of models. It began in 1957 with an initial systematic attempt at
orientation ("On causal, conditional, and structural explanatory models,"
Philosophia Naturalis, Vol. IV, No. 4, 1957, pp. 403–433) and progressed through
several stages of increasing systematization, leading to the model-theoretical
concept presented in 1965 ("Thoughts on a General Theory of Models," Studium
Generale, Vol. 18, No. 7, 1965, pp. 432–463), which I was finally able to expand
and refine into the present version of General Model Theory. At the end of 1969,
I accepted an invitation from UNESCO, Paris, to write a study on the concept of
models. This work has since been published in the collection Scientific Thought,
Volume 9 of the series New Babylon (Mouton/UNESCO, Paris-The Hague, 1972). It
can be considered, in part, as a preliminary draft of the third chapter of
General Model Theory. Other publications of mine, especially in the fields of
epistemological psychology and the theory of science, have been influenced by
the aforementioned model-theoretical investigations. My book Thinking and
Cognition in the Cybernetic Model (Vienna—New York: Springer, 2nd ed., 1969) is
also guided by their results.

With many of my readers — critical reviewers included — I consider myself to be
engaged in an extensive dialogue and collaborative effort. Therefore, I would
like to invite feedback on the present work, particularly regarding any
systematic errors, disproportions, questionable value judgments, and other
actual or potential shortcomings of the book. Only through such communication
can the approach presented here be refined, deepened, and expanded in a field
where the efforts of an individual are not sufficient for further development.
My thanks in advance to all who contribute to this.

In the early stages of my model-theoretical considerations, discussions with Mr. P.
Gäng and Prof. Dr. D. Wunderlich provided valuable suggestions during the
drafting of the manuscript. I extend my heartfelt thanks to both of them for
this. I am particularly indebted to Mr. Wunderlich for his assistance, often
extending to formal details, in the development of the logical-explanatory part
of the third chapter and the measurements contained therein. My gratitude goes
to Prof. Dr. H. Pachale, Dipl.-Math. W. Krüger, and Dipl.-Math. R.-B. Lüschow
for their critical review of the manuscript, and to Mr. Krüger for his thorough
proofreading. The compilation of the index of names, as well as the meticulous
review of the bibliography and the list of references, was made possible by Mr. H.
Radimersky. Dr. G. Wersig kindly provided me with his year-long assistance in
bibliographic research. Lastly, I must once again express my gratitude for the
indispensable technical and organizational support from my longtime assistant
Mrs. H. Stranz and my wife B. Stachowiak-Prästel.

The German Research Foundation supported my model-theoretical efforts during an
important phase of work (which had become critical for personal reasons), for
which I extend my sincere thanks.

I remain faithfully grateful to Springer Publishing for their understanding,
patience, and consistently friendly cooperation.

* Introduction

In both scientific and non-scientific usage, the concept of a model has gained
increasing relevance. On numerous appropriate — unfortunately also inappropriate
— occasions, there is talk of "models." The word "model" is often misused
thoughtlessly, just as it is found as a consciously chosen scientific term in
contexts that reveal an effort to associate it with a strictly explicated or at
least explicable meaning. In mathematics and logic, this has been realized with
significant limitations on its meaning, and some authors, who did not find this
restriction fruitful, have attempted to characterize the specific nature of the
model concept in a way that makes it clear how they intend for the term to be
understood and used. There are also approaches to taxonomic classification of
models to be found here and there. However, with most authors who refer to
models in various contexts, one largely, if not entirely, misses any
scientific-theoretical or methodological reflection on the concept of a model
that they presuppose. In such cases, its characteristics can only be inferred
indirectly from the given contexts.

It is precisely here, where the more intuitive grasp of the writer and speaker
still fulfills the function of normative terminological usage rules, that the
gradual shift in linguistic habits — as these almost imperceptibly adapt to a
particular style of thought and observation — often becomes an indication of
newly emerging general attitudes and perspectives. The growing tendency of
contemporary researchers to regard even epistemic structures as complex as
empirical scientific theories as "models," or at least to casually refer to them
as such, likely reveals a profound transformation in scientific-philosophical
thinking. This is undoubtedly a change in, among other things, the expectations
that scientists and scientifically-oriented philosophers believe they are
entitled to place on their activities and the results of those activities.

The increasing demands on the instrumental, especially prognostic, quality and
value-oriented functionality of knowledge structures have been accompanied by
the rapid decline of the classical epistemological view, which was oriented
towards the ideal of value-free, intentionless knowledge aimed at objective
"representation of reality." The generation of researchers for whom this ideal
still had influence into the early part of the second half of our century has
almost died out. Most young scientists today no longer understand the pursuit of
truth and eternity, of ultimate justification and objectivity, which was simply
guiding and decisive for most of the older generation.

[Not that there are no longer any "metaphysical" needs in matters of knowledge!
But these needs and drives have been re-centered. The distant rationalistic
dogmatism and objectivism, even in its critical (or quasi-pragmatic)
continuations from Kant to Popper, has disintegrated. The new center of a
completely secularized "metaphysical" longing is society - or rather the
socialized self - and the core theme of this longing is "emancipation." This
refers to the struggle against the suffering of the actually or supposedly
"underprivileged," which is, at its heart, a struggle against the current
"establishment." Declared partisan, the new "metaphysics" relies on social
justice. It seeks to subordinate everything to this, including the fundamental
value of individual self-realization. Its empirical evidences are essentially
hopes, and its rigidity in being unteachable makes it, in a way, a higher-order
dogmatism compared to its classical predecessor. It is even ready to declare
basic arithmetic as an expression of false consciousness — and therefore as
unscientific — if it proves to be a "repressive instrument of the
establishment." The remarkable affinity of an apparently growing number of
intellectuals to such "metaphysically" absolutized engagement will likely become
a determining or at least significantly contributing factor to the sociocultural
development in the coming years.

In the long run, however, the laboriously developed liberal forms of
philosophical discussion are likely to be perceived as largely intolerable in
the face of growing collectivist tendencies. This, of course, assumes that
humanity will be able to find and implement solutions, developed from
responsible rationality, to a series of self-destructive ailments — not least
among them the ideology of permanent technical and economic growth.]

The first chapter of this book deals primarily with the epistemological issues
surrounding the concept of a model. The philosophical stance that emerges here
is one of a pragmatist with a background in truth philosophy. Sublime
pragmatists often resemble atheists who have sought their god but have not found
him - or whose god has perhaps revealed himself to them in a blissfully alien
form. Disappointment, however, can lead to liberation, and uncovering can lead
to new forms of security.

It is necessary to state at the outset that the model theory addressed in the
second and third chapters is not identical to the semantic model theory
developed by A. Tarski. Nor is it a subfield of it. The concept of a model used
here is considerably broader. On the formal scientific side, it includes the
so-called abstract structures of mathematics, which are obtained through the
formation of equivalence classes, as well as other "formal abstraction models."
On the empirical scientific side, it encompasses the wide variety of empirical
models that appear, and it also includes technical models. Whatever else these
models may be considered, they prove to be graspable both in terms of
representation theory and in their pragmatic relations.

The fact that the concept of a model—previously used almost exclusively in an
intuitive manner outside the formal sciences, without strict definition - is
explicated in representational-theoretic terms with the indicated generality is
what sets General Model Theory apart from other approaches in scientific theory.
These other approaches, when they consider empirical models at all, typically
subject them exclusively to the (meta-)mathematical and semantic model
conception. According to these scientific theorists, the models in question are
understood as "interpretation models" or "realizations" of pre-existing
theories, i.e., as non-linguistic, set-theoretically comprehensible
interpretations of linguistic structures[fn:1].

Against the transfer of the logical-semantic concept of a model to the empirical
sciences — however logically satisfying it may always be — it must be objected
that it does not do justice in any way to the widely practiced scientific use of
language. Thus, numerous findings that would certainly qualify as models in the
sense of representation theory would be excluded merely because for them no
strict theory, of which they would be instantiation models, can yet or still
cannot be explicitly specified. Indeed, in many cases such empirical (and
technical) model constructions serve precisely the construction and development
of theories. This constitutes primarily their great heuristic value. While this
objective restriction thus appears unwise, on the other hand, the approach
preferred here carries the risk of an “over-homogenization” of the most diverse
model concepts, and thereby a significant impoverishment of meaning in the
resulting general concept of a model, which cannot presently be dismissed. This
possible shortcoming is expressly accepted here.

Regarding the aforementioned extraordinary extension of the concept of a model,
General Model Theory is by no means alone. L. APOSTEL[fn:2] already developed in
1961[fn:3] a similarly comprehensive, and likewise representation-theoretic,
model concept. His successive “liberalizations,” originating from the algebraic
concept of isomorphism and ultimately leading to his general model concept, are
nevertheless not without artificiality. Moreover, APOSTEL seems, without
compelling reason, to orient himself too strongly at the outset toward the
mathematical “relational structure” (cf. section 2.3.4.2, p. 243 ff.). The
present book takes rather the reverse path. Nevertheless, valuable specific
insights from APOSTEL’s work are taken into account herein.

What APOSTEL hints at toward the end of his exposition[fn:4] concerning the use
of a formal pragmatics is presented in this book to a certain extent. The only
viable approach so far stems from R. M. MARTIN[fn:5], who nearly fifteen years
ago initiated the field — now, however, scarcely explored — of strictly
formalized Pragmatic Logic. A few years later, he was able to extend his
classificatory “Acceptance Pragmatics,” drawing on more recent axiological
research, into a comparative and even quantitative pragmatics[fn:6]. These
investigations are not yet particularly refined, but their preliminary results
are nevertheless suitable for the model-theoretical purposes pursued here. The
entire research complex surrounding formal pragmatics and General Model Theory
naturally still requires further elaboration. Moreover, the present book is
essentially only a guidepost pointing toward a largely uncharted territory.

Accordingly, the logical formalizations undertaken in the third chapter of this
book — when compared, for example, with the high degree of formalization found
in logical-semantic and mathematical model theory — remain within very narrow
bounds. The verbal and descriptive portion of the presentation still
predominates overall. This, however, is not due solely to substantive
difficulties. The predominantly verbal character of the exposition also reflects
consideration for readers unfamiliar with Mathematical Logic, who wish to engage
with the ideas of the book without having to master the rather elaborate
formal-logical apparatus. Practicing empirical scientists and other
model-theoretically interested readers, who do not primarily concern themselves
with epistemological-logical and linguistically-analytical questions, should be
able to gain fruitful access to the subject matter without great time
investment. Hence, the exposition proceeds not predominantly deductively, but
rather inductively, by approximation. This is particularly evident in the fact
that the concepts to be explored — especially the general concept of a model —
are first discussed, exemplified, and clarified at the verbal level, before they
are subjected, wherever possible and advantageous, to stricter logical
explication. The second and the third

* Foreword

The present study is the result of many years of research surrounding the
concept of models. It began in 1957 with an initial systematic attempt at
orientation ("On causal, conditional, and structural explanatory models,"
Philosophia Naturalis, Vol. IV, No. 4, 1957, pp. 403–433) and progressed through
several stages of increasing systematization, leading to the model-theoretical
concept presented in 1965 ("Thoughts on a General Theory of Models," Studium
Generale, Vol. 18, No. 7, 1965, pp. 432–463), which I was finally able to expand
and refine into the present version of General Model Theory. At the end of 1969,
I accepted an invitation from UNESCO, Paris, to write a study on the concept of
models. This work has since been published in the collection Scientific Thought,
Volume 9 of the series New Babylon (Mouton/UNESCO, Paris-The Hague, 1972). It
can be considered, in part, as a preliminary draft of the third chapter of
General Model Theory. Other publications of mine, especially in the fields of
epistemological psychology and the theory of science, have been influenced by
the aforementioned model-theoretical investigations. My book Thinking and
Cognition in the Cybernetic Model (Vienna—New York: Springer, 2nd ed., 1969) is
also guided by their results.

With many of my readers — critical reviewers included — I consider myself to be
engaged in an extensive dialogue and collaborative effort. Therefore, I would
like to invite feedback on the present work, particularly regarding any
systematic errors, disproportions, questionable value judgments, and other
actual or potential shortcomings of the book. Only through such communication
can the approach presented here be refined, deepened, and expanded in a field
where the efforts of an individual are not sufficient for further development.
My thanks in advance to all who contribute to this.

In the early stages of my model-theoretical considerations, discussions with Mr. P.
Gäng and Prof. Dr. D. Wunderlich provided valuable suggestions during the
drafting of the manuscript. I extend my heartfelt thanks to both of them for
this. I am particularly indebted to Mr. Wunderlich for his assistance, often
extending to formal details, in the development of the logical-explanatory part
of the third chapter and the measurements contained therein. My gratitude goes
to Prof. Dr. H. Pachale, Dipl.-Math. W. Krüger, and Dipl.-Math. R.-B. Lüschow
for their critical review of the manuscript, and to Mr. Krüger for his thorough
proofreading. The compilation of the index of names, as well as the meticulous
review of the bibliography and the list of references, was made possible by Mr. H.
Radimersky. Dr. G. Wersig kindly provided me with his year-long assistance in
bibliographic research. Lastly, I must once again express my gratitude for the
indispensable technical and organizational support from my longtime assistant
Mrs. H. Stranz and my wife B. Stachowiak-Prästel.

The German Research Foundation supported my model-theoretical efforts during an
important phase of work (which had become critical for personal reasons), for
which I extend my sincere thanks.

I remain faithfully grateful to Springer Publishing for their understanding,
patience, and consistently friendly cooperation.

* Introduction

In both scientific and non-scientific usage, the concept of a model has gained
increasing relevance. On numerous appropriate — unfortunately also inappropriate
— occasions, there is talk of "models." The word "model" is often misused
thoughtlessly, just as it is found as a consciously chosen scientific term in
contexts that reveal an effort to associate it with a strictly explicated or at
least explicable meaning. In mathematics and logic, this has been realized with
significant limitations on its meaning, and some authors, who did not find this
restriction fruitful, have attempted to characterize the specific nature of the
model concept in a way that makes it clear how they intend for the term to be
understood and used. There are also approaches to taxonomic classification of
models to be found here and there. However, with most authors who refer to
models in various contexts, one largely, if not entirely, misses any
scientific-theoretical or methodological reflection on the concept of a model
that they presuppose. In such cases, its characteristics can only be inferred
indirectly from the given contexts.

It is precisely here, where the more intuitive grasp of the writer and speaker
still fulfills the function of normative terminological usage rules, that the
gradual shift in linguistic habits — as these almost imperceptibly adapt to a
particular style of thought and observation — often becomes an indication of
newly emerging general attitudes and perspectives. The growing tendency of
contemporary researchers to regard even epistemic structures as complex as
empirical scientific theories as "models," or at least to casually refer to them
as such, likely reveals a profound transformation in scientific-philosophical
thinking. This is undoubtedly a change in, among other things, the expectations
that scientists and scientifically-oriented philosophers believe they are
entitled to place on their activities and the results of those activities.

The increasing demands on the instrumental, especially prognostic, quality and
value-oriented functionality of knowledge structures have been accompanied by
the rapid decline of the classical epistemological view, which was oriented
towards the ideal of value-free, intentionless knowledge aimed at objective
"representation of reality." The generation of researchers for whom this ideal
still had influence into the early part of the second half of our century has
almost died out. Most young scientists today no longer understand the pursuit of
truth and eternity, of ultimate justification and objectivity, which was simply
guiding and decisive for most of the older generation.

[Not that there are no longer any "metaphysical" needs in matters of knowledge!
But these needs and drives have been re-centered. The distant rationalistic
dogmatism and objectivism, even in its critical (or quasi-pragmatic)
continuations from Kant to Popper, has disintegrated. The new center of a
completely secularized "metaphysical" longing is society - or rather the
socialized self - and the core theme of this longing is "emancipation." This
refers to the struggle against the suffering of the actually or supposedly
"underprivileged," which is, at its heart, a struggle against the current
"establishment." Declared partisan, the new "metaphysics" relies on social
justice. It seeks to subordinate everything to this, including the fundamental
value of individual self-realization. Its empirical evidences are essentially
hopes, and its rigidity in being unteachable makes it, in a way, a higher-order
dogmatism compared to its classical predecessor. It is even ready to declare
basic arithmetic as an expression of false consciousness — and therefore as
unscientific — if it proves to be a "repressive instrument of the
establishment." The remarkable affinity of an apparently growing number of
intellectuals to such "metaphysically" absolutized engagement will likely become
a determining or at least significantly contributing factor to the sociocultural
development in the coming years.

In the long run, however, the laboriously developed liberal forms of
philosophical discussion are likely to be perceived as largely intolerable in
the face of growing collectivist tendencies. This, of course, assumes that
humanity will be able to find and implement solutions, developed from
responsible rationality, to a series of self-destructive ailments — not least
among them the ideology of permanent technical and economic growth.]

The first chapter of this book deals primarily with the epistemological issues
surrounding the concept of a model. The philosophical stance that emerges here
is one of a pragmatist with a background in truth philosophy. Sublime
pragmatists often resemble atheists who have sought their god but have not found
him - or whose god has perhaps revealed himself to them in a blissfully alien
form. Disappointment, however, can lead to liberation, and uncovering can lead
to new forms of security.

It is necessary to state at the outset that the model theory addressed in the
second and third chapters is not identical to the semantic model theory
developed by A. Tarski. Nor is it a subfield of it. The concept of a model used
here is considerably broader. On the formal scientific side, it includes the
so-called abstract structures of mathematics, which are obtained through the
formation of equivalence classes, as well as other "formal abstraction models."
On the empirical scientific side, it encompasses the wide variety of empirical
models that appear, and it also includes technical models. Whatever else these
models may be considered, they prove to be graspable both in terms of
representation theory and in their pragmatic relations.

The fact that the concept of a model—previously used almost exclusively in an
intuitive manner outside the formal sciences, without strict definition - is
explicated in representational-theoretic terms with the indicated generality is
what sets General Model Theory apart from other approaches in scientific theory.
These other approaches, when they consider empirical models at all, typically
subject them exclusively to the (meta-)mathematical and semantic model
conception. According to these scientific theorists, the models in question are
understood as "interpretation models" or "realizations" of pre-existing
theories, i.e., as non-linguistic, set-theoretically comprehensible
interpretations of linguistic structures[fn:suppes].

Against the application of the logical-semantic concept of a model to the
empirical sciences, as logically satisfying as it may be, one can object that it
does not in any way do justice to the widely practiced scientific language.
Numerous epistemic structures that would certainly be considered models in the
representational-theoretical sense would be excluded, simply because a strict
theory, of which they would be the interpretation models, cannot or has not yet
been explicitly formulated. Indeed, in many cases, such empirical (and
technical) model constructions serve precisely to build and develop theories.
This is where their great heuristic value lies. While such object-centered
limitation seems unwise, the preferred approach here carries the risk of
"over-homogenizing" various model concepts, which could significantly empty the
resulting general concept of a model of meaning. This potential drawback is
explicitly accepted here.

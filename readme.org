This site contains the material related to the translation of the book
[[https://archive.org/details/Stachowiak1973AllgemeineModelltheorie/page/n1/mode/2up]["Allgemeine Modelltheorie"]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stachowiak][Herbert Stachowiak]] into English. The book is
freely available in the [[https://archive.org/][Internet Archive]].

* What is "General Model Theory"?

As [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stachowiak][wikipedia tells us]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+begin_quote
Stachowiak's first monograph is called "Thinking and Knowing in the Cybernetic
Model" (1965). He generalised and systematised the model concept in the standard
work "Allgemeine Modelltheorie" (General Model Theory, 1973), /which has never
been translated into English/. According to this, all cognition is cognition in
models. Models are representations of "reality", which, however, necessarily
shorten what is represented. The respective shaping of the models depends on the
model constructor, his historical and social situation as well as his cognitive
or creative interests. Thus, in addition to the depictive and foreshortening
features, it is especially the pragmatic feature that determines how models are
dealt with.
#+end_quote

* Why do we need a translation?

This work is thus of great interest of anyone working on modeling, and a lack of
an English translation is a striking gap in the literature. As it happens,
programmers think a lot about modeling. For example, take these posts from [[https://modelpractice.wordpress.com/][Model
Practice]]:

- [[https://modelpractice.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/model-stachowiak/][General Model Theory by Stachowiak]]
- [[https://modelpractice.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/stachowiak-model-system/][Stachowiakâ€™s K-System of Modelling]]

It is easy to find a number of posts such as these, making use of Stachowiak's
key concepts, but it makes one yearn for reading the primitive work rather than
its derivations. I felt this need keenly when I was writing up my own PhD Thesis
([[https://masd-project.github.io/progen/docs/models_and_transformations.html#ID-7D92A620-ED3E-D264-46A3-2A2597C59DC7][Section "Why Model?"]]).

* Limitations

Unfortunately, I am spectacularly under-qualified for this particular task:
first and foremost, I do not speak German and know very little of the language;
secondly, though a "doctor of philosophy", I am not an actual philosopher but a
mere computer scientist, and mostly a software engineer at that; and, finally,
English is not my native language. I appear to have one only redeeming quality,
which is that there are no other takers. We also have technology on our side:
the translation will be performed by automated mains --- chiefly by recourse to
[[https://chatgpt.com/][ChatGPT]] and [[https://translate.google.com/][Google Translate]].

* Approach

The project is composed of the following key files:

- [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/orginal_german.txt][=orginal_german.txt=]]: Book content as sourced from the Internet Archive.
- [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/Stachowiak%20(1973)_%20Allgemeine%20Modelltheorie.pdf][=Stachowiak (1973)_ Allgemeine Modelltheorie.pdf=]]: PDF of the original book.
- [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/german.org][=german.org=]]: Book content in the original German but formatted into Emacs'
  org-mode, from whence automated generation of other formats --- such as PDF
  and LaTex --- can be attained.
- =english.org=: Book content translated to English.

I will be manually moving content from the original German into the German
org-mode representation; then translating it into English via translation tools,
and proofreading the output. There will soon be builds which generate HTML and
PDF versions of the org-mode files.

The org-mode documents generate two types of artefacts:

- HTML output browsable as a site. For example, [[file:german.org][German]] and English.
- PDF output. This is added to each build. At present the quality of the PDFs is
  not great; we need to add a lot of LaTex magic to make it readable.

* Contributions

Note that I am working on this project in my [[http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/C/copious-free-time.html][copious free time]], so work will be
slow and halting. Any form of contributions are welcome, particularly in the
form of Pull Requests. If you want to do so, please see [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md][=CONTRIBUTING.md=]] and
[[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][=CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md=]].

* Licence

All of my work is available via the licence [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/CC-BY-4.0][CC-BY-4.0]]. I assume that, since
Stachowiak's work is available in the Internet Archive, it falls under [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain][public
domain]]. However this is entirely not clear, as per Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
A public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created
without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired or have been
forfeited.

In most countries the term of protection of copyright expires on the first day
of January, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest
copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since
July 1928.

Once I understand the exact status of the work I will update this page.

This site contains the material related to the translation of the book
[[https://archive.org/details/Stachowiak1973AllgemeineModelltheorie/page/n1/mode/2up]["Allgemeine Modelltheorie"]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stachowiak][Herbert Stachowiak]] into English. The book is
freely available in the [[https://archive.org/][Internet Archive]].

* What is "General Model Theory"?

As [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stachowiak][wikipedia tells us]]:

#+begin_quote
Stachowiak's first monograph is called "Thinking and Knowing in the Cybernetic
Model" (1965). He generalised and systematised the model concept in the standard
work "Allgemeine Modelltheorie" (General Model Theory, 1973), which has never
been translated into English. According to this, all cognition is cognition in
models. Models are representations of "reality", which, however, necessarily
shorten what is represented. The respective shaping of the models depends on the
model constructor, his historical and social situation as well as his cognitive
or creative interests. Thus, in addition to the depictive and foreshortening
features, it is especially the pragmatic feature that determines how models are
dealt with.

* Why do we need a translation?

This work is thus of great interest of anyone working on modeling, and a lack of
an English translation is a striking gap in the literature. As it happens,
programmers think a lot about modeling. For example, take these posts from [[https://modelpractice.wordpress.com/][Model
Practice]]:

- [[https://modelpractice.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/model-stachowiak/][General Model Theory by Stachowiak]]
- [[https://modelpractice.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/stachowiak-model-system/][Stachowiakâ€™s K-System of Modelling]]

It is easy to find a number of posts such as these, making use of Stachowiak's
key concepts, but it makes one yearn for reading the primitive work rather than
its derivations.

* Limitations

Unfortunately, I am spectacularly under-qualified for this particular task: I do
not speak German; though a "doctor of philosophy", I am not an actual
philosopher but a mere computer scientist, and mostly a software engineer at
that; and English is not my native language. I appear to have one only redeeming
quality, which is that there are no other takers. We also have technology on our
side: the translation will be performed by automated mains --- chiefly by
recourse to ChatGPT and Google Translate.

* Approach

The project is composed of the following key files:

- [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/orginal_german.txt][orginal_german.txt]]: Book content as sourced from the Internet Archive.
- [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/Stachowiak%20(1973)_%20Allgemeine%20Modelltheorie.pdf][Stachowiak (1973)_ Allgemeine Modelltheorie.pdf]]: PDF of the original book.
- [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/GeneralModelTheory/blob/main/german.org][german.org]]: Book content in the original German but formatted into Emacs'
  org-mode, from whence automated generation of other formats --- such as PDF
  and LaTex --- can be attained.
- =english.org=: Book content translated to English.

I am working on this project in my [[http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/C/copious-free-time.html][copious free time]], so work will be slow and
halting. Any form of contributions are welcome, particularly in the form of Pull
Requests.
